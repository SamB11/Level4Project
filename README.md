# University of Glasgow BSc (hons.) in Computer Science Level 4 Project
This repository contains the code for my BSc Dissertation for which I received an A.

The repository contains models trained, datasets used, as well as notebooks used for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

This was a research project, therefor the code is not as descriptive as the dissertation itself, which can be found in this repository as 'Convolutional Approaches to Facial Age Estimation.pdf'
